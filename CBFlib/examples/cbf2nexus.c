 * The Crystallographic Information File (CIF)[1] is a standard for   *
 * information interchange promulgated by the International Union of  *
 * Crystallography (IUCr). CIF (Hall, Allen & Brown, 1991) is the     *
 * recommended method for submitting publications to Acta             *
 * Crystallographica Section C and reports of crystal structure       *
 * determinations to other sections of Acta Crystallographica         *
 * and many other journals. The syntax of a CIF is a subset of the    *
 * more general STAR File[2] format. The CIF and STAR File approaches *
 * are used increasingly in the structural sciences for data exchange *
 * and archiving, and are having a significant influence on these     *
 * activities in other fields.                                        *
 *                                                                    *

 * The IUCr's interest in the STAR File is as a general data          *
 * interchange standard for science, and its interest in the CIF,     *
 * a conformant derivative of the STAR File, is as a concise data     *
 * exchange and archival standard for crystallography and structural  *
 * science.                                                           *

 * data from a file conformant to the STAR File syntax, or the CIF    *
 * syntax, respectively.                                              *

 * * Software claiming to write files in either the STAR File, or     *
 * the CIF, standard must produce files that are conformant to the    *

 *                                                                    *
 * * Software claiming to read definitions from a specific data       *
